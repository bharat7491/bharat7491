- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bharat, a front end developer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mobile/web app development. I cant avoid thinking about the coding logic about the things around me. For example upon seeing traffic lights I straightaway start thinking of logical conditions behind it.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™d like to be a full stack developer with modern tech stack.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redux for a web development and my cross platform mobile app development stack is React native, AWS, GraphQL. Trying to learn firebase too.
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me at bharatchavda7491@yahoo.com
